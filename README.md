## CRUD

Welcome to the my CRUD aplication.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## How it works

Consist of a Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) application data about a student. it works with an API that shows the student's full address only with the ZIP Code that was provided by the user when they creating a new student profile. In addition, name, date of birth and other data must provide by the user. All of this data is saved at Database (Microsoft SQL Server). later, this data can be manipulated by CRUD verbs, with an interative menu in the terminal.
